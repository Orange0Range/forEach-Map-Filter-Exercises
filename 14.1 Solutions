Part One: Solidify Terminology

In your own terms, define the following terms:

    What is HTTP?   web protocol: hypertext transfer protocol
    What is a URL?  Human usable addresses for content
    What is DNS?    Domain Name Service: Converts human usable address to IP address
    What is a query string? Provides additional information, provide command to get information.
    What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? Get-info sent as query; Post-info sent as body(modifies)
    What is an HTTP request?  Method, HTTP protocol, URL, headers
    What is an HTTP response? HTTP protocol, response status, headers
    What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
      GET/POST/Delete/PUT  200/404
    What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
      Check for IP of URL in computer cache, router, ISP, and finally the DNS servers. 

Part Two: Practice Tools

    Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
    Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com
    icanhazdadjoke.com.     0       IN      A       172.67.211.64
    icanhazdadjoke.com.     0       IN      A       104.21.37.176
    Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.
    Done
Part Three: Explore Dev Tools

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.
Part Four: Explore the URL API
