My name is Shehnil Ali, I've worked as an Electrical Engineer for the past 7 years working in product developemnt and support.
I have a history of learning new technologies on the job and look to leverage that experince in my transition to the full-stack software development world. 
I am currently enrolled in a program to learn the necessary skills to join a fast paced software team and start contributing from day one.
